<p>Machine Learning models are as good as the data they consume🍴Data impacts performance, fairness, robustness &amp; scalability of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML">#ML</a> Systems. If not taken care of, it leads to a TON of tech debt over time in a corporate setting, downstream effects of which are termed as DATA CASCADES 🌊 🧵👇🏻</p>

 <p><strong>TROUBLEMAKER</strong> 😈🙅🏻‍♀️😼 Often the issues originate early in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML">#ML</a> system’s life cycle, for example at the stage where we collect or annotate the data. These seemingly small issues grow larger into complex challenges affecting the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MachineLearning">#MachineLearning</a> model development and deployment.</p>
 
 <p><strong>DETECT ‘EM</strong> 🕵🏻‍♀️👀🤓 The diagnosis of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataCascades">#DataCascades</a> is a tough one, especially since there are no clear indicators, tools, to detect them or well-defined metrics to measure their long term effects. We can and should prioritize data in an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML">#ML</a> system along with model development.</p>
 
 <p><strong>DATA FIRST</strong> 🎖🎁🏆  Efforts towards bringing empiricism in data should be incentivized in the organization (and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MachineLearning">#MachineLearning</a> community as a whole). This means recognizing work on rewarding dataset collection, labeling, cleaning, or maintenance, as much as any modeling work.</p>
 
 <p><strong>MONITOR YOUR DATA </strong>👀📈🔬 Similar to developing good model performance metrics, we should develop metrics to measure health &amp; goodness of data too! Metrics related to data distribution, feature coverage, data freshness, etc. can be used to measure/identify <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataCascades">#DataCascades</a> early on.</p>
 
 <p><strong>SCULPT IT RIGHT</strong> 🧱⏳📖 To avoid <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataCascading">#DataCascading</a>, get started right by fostering data literacy for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MachineLearning">#MachineLearning</a>. Read through <a href="https://twitter.com/DataForML">@DataForML</a> and learn how to create your very own quality dataset using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python">#Python</a> and other <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenSource">#OpenSource</a> tools!</p>
