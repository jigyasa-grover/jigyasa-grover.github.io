<p><strong>DATA QUALITY</strong> refers to the qualitative/quantitative state of information we possess. Factors like accuracy, completeness, consistency, reliability, and whether data is up to date can help us measure it ⚖️ Check out this cool illustration by <a href="https://twitter.com/GradientFlowR">@GradientFlowR</a>!</p>

<p>However sophisticated our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MachineLearning">#MachineLearning</a> models might be, poor quality data can never help effectively solve the problem at hand. Here are some pointers to keep a quality check on our data going forward 🤟🏻</p>

<p>The first step is to understand data, and how it solves our use case, a concept called <strong>DATA PROFILING</strong> 🥸 It involves reviewing the source, understanding structure, summarizing data volume, side-information, other stats, etc. This step helps uncover quality issues from the get-go.</p>

<p>Data changes over time, so it’s crucial to develop <strong>DATA HEALTH MEASUREMENTS</strong> to signal when quality degrades 📉 Metrics developed along the data quality dimensions mentioned previously can be very helpful in continuous health monitoring and we can tailor them for our use cases.</p>

<p>Despite all checks, quality issues might still creep in. This is where <strong>DATA REPAIR</strong> comes into play 🛠️ We should invest in tools that help in error diagnosis &amp; automatically apply easy fixes like deduplication, imputation, etc. while seeking manual help for advanced resolutions.</p>
