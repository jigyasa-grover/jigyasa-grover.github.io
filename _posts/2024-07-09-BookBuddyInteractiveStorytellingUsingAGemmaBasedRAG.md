<p>In the realm of AI-driven interactive storytelling, the fusion of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Google's Gemma language model opens new avenues for creating engaging narratives and educational experiences. RAG, often likened to an "open-book" approach for AI, empowers models like Gemma to access and synthesize vast amounts of information to answer specific queries or weave intricate tales.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">RAG and Gemma ü§ùüèª</h2>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</a> leverages a dual-model approach: a retriever to fetch relevant information and a generator to craft responses in natural language. This method not only enhances the accuracy of AI-generated content but also reduces computational overhead compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.</p>

<p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma">Gemma</a>, a lightweight, text-to-text, decoder-only large language model, is known for its precision and efficiency, emerges as an ideal candidate for such tasks, making it a potent tool for interactive storytelling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Crafting Interactive Narratives üè∞</h2>

<p>Imagine a scenario where readers can interact with a virtual "Book Buddy," a character powered by Gemma-based RAG. This AI companion can dynamically respond to queries from the storylines and provide detailed explanations on demand. Whether guiding readers through complex plotlines or explaining background lore, Gemma excels in delivering coherent, engaging content tailored to user interactions.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let's Build "Book Buddy" üõ†Ô∏è</strong></h1>

<p>To delve deeper into the capabilities of Gemma-based RAG for interactive storytelling, let's embark on a hands-on journey that creates a dynamic system capable of answering questions about the classic text <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt">"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll</a>, available from Project Gutenberg.</p>

<p>By leveraging Gemma's capabilities, we can prototype interactive narratives that respond intelligently to user prompts, offering a personalized storytelling experience. Whether deployed in educational settings to elucidate historical events or within gaming environments to create dynamic quests, the versatility of Gemma-based RAG enriches the user experience through immersive, responsive storytelling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up the environment üå≥</h2>

from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader, PyPDFLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain_community.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings
from langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceEndpoint
```

<p>Setting environment variables for the user agent and Hugging Face Hub API token. These ensure that all web requests are identified as originating from the <em>"book_buddy/1.0"</em> user agent and authorize the use of Hugging Face's API.</p>

```
os.environ['USER_AGENT'] = 'book_buddy/1.0'
os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN'] = userdata.get('HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN')
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loading and splitting the data üìö</h2>

<p>Specifying the document source and defining other parameters like <em>chunk_size</em> and <em>chunk_overlap</em> for splitting the text into manageable chunks. Here we use the URL for <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt">Project Gutenberg's book text for "Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll"</a>.</p>

```
BOOK_TEXT_WEB_SOURCE = "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt"
TEXT_SPLITTER_CHUNK_SIZE = 1000
TEXT_SPLITTER_CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200
```

<p>The LangChain's <a href="https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_base/">WebBaseLoader</a> is utilized to load the text from the specified URL.</p>

book_data_loader = WebBaseLoader(BOOK_TEXT_WEB_SOURCE)
book_data = book_data_loader.load()

<p>The objective of splitting the data is to partition lengthy text documents into smaller, more digestible segments or chunks. This practice enhances efficiency in NLP tasks, addressing constraints that models may encounter with processing extensive amounts of text in a single instance. Here we use the <a href="https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html">RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</a>  to split the document into chunks of <em>TEXT_SPLITTER_CHUNK_SIZE</em> characters, with an overlap of <em>TEXT_SPLITTER_CHUNK_OVERLAP</em> characters to maintain context across chunks.</p>

```
recursive_character_text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size = text_splitter_chunk_size, 
        chunk_overlap = text_splitter_chunk_overlap
)
recursive_character_text_splits = recursive_character_text_splitter.split_documents(book_data)
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loading the embedding model ü§≥üèª</h2>

<p>The next step involves converting textual data into numerical vectors (embeddings) for the text chunks using the <em>SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL</em>. Here we use <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> which maps sentences and paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can</p>

```
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

sentence_transformer_embeddings = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(
          model_name = SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL
      )
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Storing the embeddings in a vector database üß≥</h2>

<p>These embeddings are now stored in a specialized / vector database (<a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">Chroma</a>) optimized for fast searches and similarity comparisons.</p>

```
chroma_vector_db = Chroma.from_documents(
          documents = recursive_character_text_splits, 
          embedding = sentence_transformer_embeddings
 )
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up the retriever üî¨</h2>

<p>Setting up a retrieval mechanism to query the previously created vector database using <em>RETREIVER_SEARCH_TYPE</em> and <em>RETREIVER_SEARCH_K</em> configuration to ensure diverse and relevant results. The retriever is designed to locate text chunks that exhibit semantic similarity to a specified query. Here we use MMR = Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) as the search type for our retriever since it considers the similarity of keywords/keyphrases with the document, along with the similarity of already selected keywords and keyphrases. This results in a selection that maximizes the diversity with respect to the document.</p>

```
RETREIVER_SEARCH_TYPE = "mmr"
RETREIVER_SEARCH_K = 2

retriever = chroma_vector_db.as_retriever(
          search_type = retriever_search_type, 
          search_kwargs={"k": retriever_search_k}
 )
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up the generator üé°</h2>

<p>The generator here leverages advanced language modeling techniques to generate human-like answers, enhancing the user experience. Here the language model used for generating responses is <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma">Gemma</a> by Google.</p>

```
GENERATOR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_REPO_ID = "google/gemma-1.1-2b-it"
GENERATOR_MAX_LENGTH = 1024
GENERATOR_TEMPERATURE = 0.1

large_language_model = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
          repo_id = GENERATOR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_REPO_ID, 
          max_length = GENERATOR_MAX_LENGTH, 
          temperature = GENERATOR_TEMPERATURE
)
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up the conversational retrieval chain ‚õìÔ∏è</h2>

<p>The core of the interactive storytelling application is the <a href="https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.base.ConversationalRetrievalChain.html">ConversationalRetrievalChain</a>, which ties together the language model and the retriever. This chain is designed to locate pertinent information, with the language model, engineered to generate coherent text. Together, they form a unified and robust component. This integration facilitates a seamless and intuitive question-and-answer interaction for users. In short, this chain allows the system to process user queries, retrieve relevant text chunks, and generate coherent answers.</p>

```
conversational_retrieval_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
          llm = large_language_model, 
          retriever = retriever
)
```

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Asking "Book Buddy" a question üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>

<p>The response from the conversational retrieval chain contains chat history, the question asked, and the answer.</p>

```
response = self.conversational_retrieval_chain.invoke({
            "question": question, 
            "chat_history": chat_history
