            <i>[<b>January 2021</b>]</i> Co-authored my first book titled <b>Sculpting Data for ML: The first act of Machine Learning</b> with <a href="https://rishabhmisra.github.io/" target="_blank">Rishabh Misra</a>. Now available on Amazon, buy your copy here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RN47C5T" target="_blank">www.amazon.com/dp/B08RN47C5T</a>!
		<br/><br/> Sculpting Data for ML introduces the readers to the first act of Machine Learning, Dataset Curation. This book puts forward practical tips to identify valuable information from the extensive amount of crude data available at our fingertips. The step-by-step guide accompanies code examples in Python from the extraction of real-world datasets and illustrates ways to hone the skills of extracting meaningful datasets. In addition, the book also dives deep into how data fits into the Machine Learning ecosystem and tries to highlight the impact good quality data can have on the Machine Learning system's performance.
		<br/><br/> The book is endorsed by leading ML experts in both Academia and the Industry, and has forewords by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley" target="_blank">Julian McAuley, Associate Professor at UC San Diego</a>, <a href="http://laurencemoroney.com/" target="_blank">Laurence Moroney, AI Lead Advocate at Google</a>, and <a href="https://mengtingwan.github.io/" target="_blank">Mengting Wan, Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft</a>.
