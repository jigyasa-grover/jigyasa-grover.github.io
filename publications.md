### [**Do not 'fake it till you make it'! - Synopsis of fake news detection methodologies on social media**](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031108716)
* This research publication analyzes the definition and forms of fake news on social media, and is a comparative study of deep learning models to identify phony information, verify the validity of various claims and facts, catch fake content, and so on.
* It discusses limitations of deep learning with insights into the fairness, interpretability, and accountability of the fake news detection algorithms.
* Accepted in **Springer** published book titled ['Deep Learning for Social Media Data Analytics'](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031108716) (to be released in _November 2022_) as a part of their popular book series [Studies in Big Data](https://www.springer.com/series/11970).

### [**Sculpting Data for ML: The first act of Machine Learning**](https://www.amazon.com/Sculpting-Data-ML-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B08RN47C5T/)
* The [book]((https://www.amazon.com/Sculpting-Data-ML-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B08RN47C5T/)) introduces the readers to the first act of Machine Learning, {\slshape{Dataset Curation}}. This step-by-step guide accompanies code examples in Python from the extraction of real-world datasets and practical tips to identify valuable information on web. In addition, it also dives deep into how data fits into the Machine Learning ecosystem and highlights the impact of data-centric approaches on ML systemâ€™s performance.
* Till date, delivered 25+ talks across US and beyond to champion the importance of data in Machine Learning under the [\#DataForML](https://twitter.com/DataForML/) campaign.
* Endorsed by leading ML experts in Academia and Industry; Forewords by: [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), [Laurence Moroney](https://laurencemoroney.com/), and [Mengting Wan](https://mengtingwan.github.io/).
* It is available both as paperback and Kindle eBook, grab a copy [here](https://www.amazon.com/Sculpting-Data-ML-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B08RN47C5T/)!

### [**Pragmatic Insights: Live UIs for Agent-based Modelling in Pharo**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3139903.3139915)
* This [ACM publication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3139903.3139915) focuses on spatial interface of agent-based simulation platforms to visualize the evolution of the system through time. It analyses state-of-the-art, scrutinizing in terms of programming flexibility, extensibility, portability, scalability, and interaction. Subsequently it highlights the efforts in building an open-source extension for CORMAS' spatial interface in Pharo.
* Presented at the 12th edition of the **International Workshop on Smalltalk Technologies** held in Maribor, Slovenia.

### [**Pharo by Example 5.0**](https://books.pharo.org/updated-pharo-by-example/)
* As an _Open Source Developer_, contributed to this [book](https://books.pharo.org/updated-pharo-by-example/) published by [Square Bracket Associates](https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates) that introduces the Pharo programming environment, the language and the associated tools. It also puts forward common practices of the Pharo environment with a focus on object-oriented design.
