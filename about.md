<div class="column leftcol" style="text-align:justify;padding-right:40px">

<p>My name is <strong>Jigyasa Grover</strong> (pronounced as <em>JIG-yah-suh GROH-ver</em>).</p>
 
<p><strong>10-time award winner</strong> in Artificial Intelligence and Open Source and the <strong>co-author of the book 'Sculpting Data For ML'</strong>, I am striving to make a dent in this world of technology and bridge the gaps. As an AI & Research Lead at <strong>Bordo AI</strong> currently, I have years of ML engineering & Data Science experience in deploying large‐scale low-latency systems for user personalization and monetization on popular social networking apps like <strong>Twitter</strong> (now X) and <strong>Facebook</strong> (now Meta), and e‐commerce at <strong>Faire</strong>, particularly ads prediction, sponsored content ranking, and recommendation with a recent focus on Generative AI. I am also one of the few ML <strong>Google Developer Experts</strong> and Google Women Techmaker Ambassadors globally. As a <strong>World Economic Forum</strong> Global Shaper at the Palo Alto Hub, I ensure to leverage my technical skills and connections for solution-building, policy-making, and lasting change.</p>
 
<p>Recently, I was <strong><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/live/XEzRZ35urlk?t=516" target="_blank">featured at Google I/O 2024 main keynote</a></strong> and introduced by <i>Sundar Pichai</i> on the stage as I spoke about my experience using Gemini 1.5 Pro’s 1 million token context window. As a part of the <strong>Google Developer Advisory Board (gDAB)</strong> I collaborate with experts and contribute to shaping the future of Google's developer ecosystem. I am also involved with Google Developer Experts and Google for Startups, and most recently was on the Generative AI panel with some renowned folks from the industry and startup world.</p>
 
<p>My latest research <strong>'Keeping it Low‑Key'</strong> is focused on igniting the public dialogue regarding privacy impacts, ethical consequences, fairness, and real-world harms of non-privacy-compliant ML systems. I have also co-authored a book chapter <strong>‘Do not fake it till you make it!’</strong>, which is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning in a world-renowned Springer book series.</p>
 
<p>In my spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in <strong>“we rise by lifting others”</strong>, I mentor aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I am also an Advisory Board Member at Bezoku AI, Las Positas Community College, AI Forum, Corinium Global Intelligence, and VigiTrust. To help budding authors and writers, I serve as a technical book reviewer for O'Reilly Media and Packt Publishing House.</p>
 
<p>Having graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master’s degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization, my journey is highlighted by a myriad of experiences from my stints at Faire, Twitter/X, Facebook/Meta, National Research Council Canada, Institute of Research & Development France, San Diego Supercomputer Center involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.</p>
 
<p>I am an avid proponent of Open Source and credit my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, and many more. I have <strong>150+ media features, keynotes, conference talks, panels, workshops, and podcasts</strong> to my name, with renowned entities like <strong>Google, United Nations, NTD Business, International Business Times</strong>, SiliconAngle, CubeTV, etc. My love for tinkering has led me to win 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges' panel of hackathons.</p>
 
<p>Apart from my technological ventures, I enjoy exploring hidden gems in my city, hanging out with friends and family, and have been recently having fun with baking.
