Hey üëãüèª Thank you for dropping by! 
 
<p>My name is <strong>Jigyasa Grover</strong> (pronounced as <em>JIG-yah-suh GROH-ver</em>) and I have 5+ years of ML engineering & Data Science experience in deploying large‚Äêscale systems for monetization on social networking & e‚Äêcommerce platforms with a focus on ads prediction, sponsored content ranking & recommendation. <strong>10-time award winner</strong> in the field of AI and Open Source, I am also one of the few <strong>ML Google Developer Experts</strong> globally.</p>
 
<p>At present, I am working as a <strong>Senior Data Scientist</strong> at Faire, where I am building paid brands placements (ads) marketplace and ranking engine from the ground up to diversify company revenue streams.</p>. Previously, I was at Twitter as a <strong>Senior Machine Learning Engineer</strong> in the <strong>Online Ads Prediction &amp; Ranking</strong> domain, where I worked towards boosting the revenue and other advertising metrics of the platform as a part of the Monetization / Revenue Science team. I have driedn projects spanning ML model quality and performance improvements (viz. conversion rate, cost per conversion, revenue), feature engineering (feature set extension, imputation, and importance pipelines), privacy preserving, Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT) remediation, and SKAdNetwork mobile attribution and measurement. </p>
 
<p>I co-authored a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sculpting-Data-ML-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B08RN47C5T/"><strong>&#39;Sculpting Data for ML: The first act of Machine Learning&#39;</strong></a> that campaigns for a data-centric approach to ML and is a practical guide on curating quality datasets that lay a strong foundation for an ML pipeline. Hinged on this ideology of throwing the limelight on the mindful practices of dataset curation, I have been proactively sharing my views and best practices in form of technical talks, panels, podcasts, blog posts, and so on. My latest research titled <strong>‚ÄòDo not fake it till you make it!‚Äô</strong> is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning, which will soon be published in a world-renowned Springer book series. Having graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization, my journey is also highlighted by a myriad of experiences from my brief stints at Facebook, the National Research Council of Canada, and the Institute of Research &amp; Development France involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.</p>
 
<p>I am an avid proponent of open-source and credit the access to opportunities and my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, GHC India, etc. I currently lead the open-source and ML track for Anita Borg&#39;s IWiC group and co-lead the Women@ML BRG at Twitter, to provide a safe circle for professional growth, collaboration, and advocacy. I am the <strong>Program Chair</strong> for PyBay, co-chair of the Financial Aid Committee for Python Software Foundation, and have also served as the Director of Women Who Code and Lead of Women Techmakers for a handful of years to help bridge the gender gap in technology. In my spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in <em>‚Äúwe rise by lifting others‚Äù</em>, I mentor aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I have 125+ conference talks, panels, keynotes, technical workshops, and podcasts to my name, with renowned publishers like United Nations, Red Hat, Python Software Foundation, Systers, Lead Dev, Women in Science &amp; Engineering, IEEE, etc. My love for tinkering has led me to win 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges&#39; panel of hackathons.</p>
 
<p>Apart from my technological ventures, I enjoy exploring hidden gems in my city, hanging out with friends and family, and have been recently having fun with baking.
