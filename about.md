Hey üëãüèª Thank you for dropping by! 


<p>I am a <strong>Senior Machine Learning Engineer</strong> at Twitter working in the <strong><em>Online Ads Prediction &amp; Ranking</em></strong> domain, where I am spearheading a variety of projects spanning ML model development, feature engineering, user tracking transparency remediations, and monetizing new Twitter products. Recently, I won the <strong>Oustanding Women in AI Award</strong> for my contributions to this field and efforts in inspiring and empowering the future generation. I am also one of the few <strong>ML Google Developer Experts</strong> globally. </p>
<p>I co-authored a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sculpting-Data-ML-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B08RN47C5T/"><strong>&#39;Sculpting Data for ML: The first act of Machine Learning&#39;</strong></a> that campaigns for a data-centric approach to ML and is a practical guide on curating quality datasets that lay a strong foundation for an ML pipeline. Hinged on this ideology of throwing limelight on the mindful practices of dataset curation, I have been proactively sharing my views and best practices in form of technical talks, panels, podcasts, blog posts, and so on. My latest research titled <strong>‚ÄòDo not fake it till you make it!‚Äô</strong> is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning, which will soon be published in a world-renowned Springer book series. Having graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization, my journey is also highlighted by a myriad of experiences from her brief stints at Facebook, the National Research Council of Canada, and the Institute of Research &amp; Development France involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat &#39;Women in Open Source&#39; Academic Award</strong> winner and <strong>Moxie Women in Tech Award</strong> Winner, I am an avid proponent of open-source and credit the access to opportunities and my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, GHC India, etc. I currently lead the open-source and ML track for Anita Borg&#39;s IWiC group and co-leads the Women@ML BRG at Twitter, to provide a safe circle for professional growth, collaboration, and advocacy. I am the <strong>Program Chair</strong> for PyBay, co-chair of the Financial Aid Committee for Python Software Foundation, and have also served as the Director of Women Who Code and Lead of Women Techmakers for a handful of years to help bridge the gender gap in technology. In her spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in <em>‚Äúwe rise by lifting others‚Äù</em>, she mentors aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I have 125+ conference talks, panels, keynotes, technical workshops, and podcasts to her name, with renowned publishers like United Nations, Red Hat, Python Software Foundation, Systers, Lead Dev, Women in Science &amp; Engineering, IEEE, etc. My love for tinkering has led me to win 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges&#39; panel of hackathons.</p>
<p>Apart from her technological ventures, she enjoys exploring hidden gems in her city, hanging out with friends and family, and has been recently having fun with baking.
