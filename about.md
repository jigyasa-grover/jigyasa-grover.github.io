Hey üëãüèª Thank you for dropping by! 


I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Twitter working in the performance ads ranking domain. I am also one of the few ML Google Developer Experts globally. I recently co-authored a book titled 'Sculpting Data for ML' that campaigns for a data-centric approach to ML and is a practical guide on curating quality datasets that lay a strong foundation of an ML pipeline. I graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master's degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization and have a myriad of experiences from my brief stints at Facebook, National Research Council of Canada, and Institute of Research & Development France involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.

Red Hat 'Women in Open Source' Academic Award Winner, I am an avid proponent of open-source and credit the access to opportunities and my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, GHC India, etc. I currently lead the open-source and ML track for Anita Borg's IWiC group, co-lead the Women@ML BRG at Twitter, and co-chair the Financial Aid Committee for Python Software Foundation. I also served as the Director of Women Who Code and Lead of Women Techmakers for a handful of years to help bridge the gender gap in technology. 

In my spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in "we rise by lifting others", I mentor aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I have 100+ conference talks, panels, keynotes, technical workshops, and podcasts to my name, which I have conducted in 10+ countries and countless cities across the US. My love for tinkering has led my win in 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges panel of hackathons. Apart from my technological ventures, I enjoy exploring hidden gems in my city, hanging out with friends and family, and have been recently having fun with baking.
