<div class="column leftcol" style="text-align:justify;padding-right:40px">

<p>My name is <strong>Jigyasa Grover</strong> (pronounced as <em>JIG-yah-suh GROH-ver</em>).</p>
 
<p><strong>10-time award winner</strong> in Artificial Intelligence and Open Source and the <strong>co-author of the book 'Sculpting Data For ML'</strong>, I am striving to make a dent in this world of technology and bridge the gaps. I have 5+ years of ML engineering &amp; Data Science experience in deploying large‐scale systems for monetization on social networking and e‐commerce platforms with a focus on ads prediction, sponsored content ranking, and recommendation. I am also one of the few ML <strong>Google Developer Experts</strong> globally.</p>
 
<p>At present, I am at <strong>Faire</strong> as a Senior Data Scientist, building paid brands placements (ads) marketplace and ranking engine from the ground up to diversify company revenue streams. Previously, I was at <strong>Twitter</strong> as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in the Online Ads Prediction &amp; Ranking domain, where I worked towards boosting the revenue and other advertising metrics of the platform. I have driven projects spanning ML model quality and performance improvements (viz. conversion rate, cost per conversion, revenue), feature engineering (feature set extension, imputation, and importance pipelines), privacy-preserving, Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT) remediation, and SKAdNetwork mobile attribution and measurement.</p>
 
<p>I campaign for a data-centric approach to ML, and my book is a practical guide on curating quality datasets that lay a strong foundation for an ML pipeline. Hinged on this ideology of throwing the limelight on the mindful practices of dataset curation, I have been proactively sharing my views and best practices in the form of technical talks, panels, podcasts, blog posts, and so on. My latest research <strong>'Keeping it Low‑Key'</strong> is focused on igniting the public dialogue regarding privacy impacts, ethical consequences, fairness, and real-world harms of non-privacy-compliant ML systems. I have also co-authored a chapter <strong>&lsquo;Do not fake it till you make it!&rsquo;,</strong> which is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning in a world-renowned Springer book series. To help budding authors and writers, I am also serving as a <strong>technical book reviewer</strong> for O'Reilly Media and Packt Publishing House.</p>
 
<p>Having graduated from the <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong>, with a Master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science and an Artificial Intelligence specialization, my journey is highlighted by a myriad of experiences from my stints at Faire, Twitter, <strong>Facebook/Meta</strong>, <strong>National Research Council Canada</strong>, <strong>Institute of Research &amp; Development France</strong>, San Diego Supercomputer Center involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.</p>
<p>I am an <strong>avid proponent of open-source</strong> and credit the access to opportunities and my career growth to this sphere of community development. In my spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in <strong>&ldquo;we rise by lifting others&rdquo;</strong>, I mentor aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I share my experiences and knowledge as an <strong>Advisory Board Member</strong> for the Las Positas Community College, AI Forum, Corinium Global Intelligence, and VigiTrust. I currently lead the open-source and ML track for Anita Borg's IWiC group and am also the <strong>Program Chair</strong> for PyBay. In the past, I led the Women@ML BRG, to provide a safe circle for professional growth, collaboration, and advocacy. I have also served as the Director of Women Who Code and Lead of Google Women Techmakers for a handful of years to help bridge the gender gap in technology.</p>
 
<p>I am a proud recipient of multiple grants for my research and travels globally from Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook, European Smalltalk Users Group, Python Software Foundation, Twitter, and many more. I have <strong>150+ media features, keynotes, conference talks, panels, workshops, and podcasts</strong> to my name, with renowned entities like <strong>Google, United Nations, NTD Business, International Business Times</strong>, SiliconAngle, CubeTV, etc. My love for tinkering has led me to win 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges' panel of hackathons.</p>
 
<p>Apart from my technological ventures, I enjoy exploring hidden gems in my city, hanging out with friends and family, and have been recently having fun with baking.
