Hey üëãüèª Thank you for dropping by! 


I am a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** at Twitter working in the ***Online Ads Prediction & Ranking*** domain, where I am spearheading a variety of projects spanning ML model development, feature engineering, user tracking transparency remediations, and monetizing new Twitter products. Recently, I won the **Oustanding Women in AI Award** for my contributions to this field and efforts in inspiring and empowering the future generation. I am also one of the few **ML Google Developer Experts** globally. 

I co-authored a book titled [**'Sculpting Data for ML: The first act of Machine Learning'**](https://www.amazon.com/Sculpting-Data-ML-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B08RN47C5T/) that campaigns for a data-centric approach to ML and is a practical guide on curating quality datasets that lay a strong foundation for an ML pipeline. Hinged on this ideology of throwing limelight on the mindful practices of dataset curation, I have been proactively sharing my views and best practices in form of technical talks, panels, podcasts, blog posts, and so on. My latest research titled **‚ÄòDo not fake it till you make it!‚Äô** is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning, which will soon be published in a world-renowned Springer book series. Having graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization, my journey is also highlighted by a myriad of experiences from her brief stints at Facebook, the National Research Council of Canada, and the Institute of Research & Development France involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.

**Red Hat 'Women in Open Source' Academic Award** winner and **Moxie Women in Tech Award** Winner, I am an avid proponent of open-source and credit the access to opportunities and my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, GHC India, etc. I currently lead the open-source and ML track for Anita Borg's IWiC group and co-leads the Women@ML BRG at Twitter, to provide a safe circle for professional growth, collaboration, and advocacy. I am the **Program Chair** for PyBay, co-chair of the Financial Aid Committee for Python Software Foundation, and have also served as the Director of Women Who Code and Lead of Women Techmakers for a handful of years to help bridge the gender gap in technology. In her spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in *‚Äúwe rise by lifting others‚Äù*, she mentors aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I have 125+ conference talks, panels, keynotes, technical workshops, and podcasts to her name, with renowned publishers like United Nations, Red Hat, Python Software Foundation, Systers, Lead Dev, Women in Science & Engineering, IEEE, etc. My love for tinkering has led me to win 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges' panel of hackathons.

Apart from her technological ventures, she enjoys exploring hidden gems in her city, hanging out with friends and family, and has been recently having fun with baking.
