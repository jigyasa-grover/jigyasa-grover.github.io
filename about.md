Hey üëãüèª Thank you for dropping by! 

</br>
I am a <b>Machine Learning Engineer</b> by profession and currently work at <b>Twitter, Inc.</b> in San Francisco. I recently wrote a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RN47C5T">Sculpting Data for ML: The first act of Machine Learning</a> which is a culmination of my myriad of experiences from my brief stints at <b>Facebook, Inc.</b>, <b>National Research Council of Canada</b>, and <b>Institute of Research & Development France</b> involving Data Science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering. 

</br>Having graduated from the <b>University of California, San Diego</b>, with a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization, I am presently plying my past experiences and knowledge towards Applied Machine Learning in the online advertisements prediction and ranking domain. 

</br><b>Red Hat 'Women in Open Source' Academic Award Winner</b> and <b>Google Summer of Code</b> alumna, I am an ardent open-source contributor as well. I served as the Director of <b>Women Who Code</b> and Lead of Women Techmakers for a handful of years to help bridge the gender gap in technology. In my quest to build a powerful community of girls and boys alike, and believing in <i>‚Äúwe rise by lifting others‚Äù</i>, I mentor aspiring developers and Machine Learning enthusiasts in various global programs. 

</br>I also have many international conference keynotes, technical talks, panels, workshops, blogs, and podcasts to her name. Apart from my technological ventures, I enjoys exploring new places (I have solo traveled to 15+ countries in 4 continents so far‚úàÔ∏è), hanging out with friends and family, and have been recently having fun with baking.
