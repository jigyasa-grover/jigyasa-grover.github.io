<p>My name is <strong>Jigyasa Grover</strong> (pronounced as <em>JIG-yah-suh GROH-ver</em>).</p>
 
<p><strong>10-time award winner</strong> in Artificial Intelligence and Open Source and the <strong>co-author of the book 'Sculpting Data For ML'</strong>, I am striving to make a dent in this world of technology and bridge the gaps. As an AI & Research Lead, I have years of ML engineering & Data Science experience in deploying large‐scale low-latency systems for user personalization and monetization on popular social networking apps like Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta), and e‐commerce at Faire, particularly ads prediction, sponsored content ranking, and recommendation with a recent focus on Generative AI. I am also one of the few ML <strong>Google Developer Experts</strong>strong> and Google Women Techmaker Ambassadors globally. As a World Economic Forum’s Global Shaper, I ensure to leverage my technical skills and connections for solution-building, policy-making, and lasting change.</p>
 
<p>My latest research <strong>'Keeping it Low‑Key'</strong>strong> is focused on igniting the public dialogue regarding privacy impacts, ethical consequences, fairness, and real-world harms of non-privacy-compliant ML systems. I have also co-authored a book chapter ‘Do not fake it till you make it!’, which is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning in a world-renowned Springer book series.</p>
 
<p>In my spirit to build a powerful community with a strong belief in <strong>“we rise by lifting others”</strong>strong>, I mentor aspiring developers and ML enthusiasts in various global programs. I am also an Advisory Board Member at Bezoku AI, Las Positas Community College, AI Forum, Corinium Global Intelligence, and VigiTrust. To help budding authors and writers, I serve as a technical book reviewer for O'Reilly Media and Packt Publishing House.</p>
 
<p>Having graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master’s degree in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence specialization, my journey is highlighted by a myriad of experiences from my stints at Faire, Twitter/X, Facebook/Meta, National Research Council Canada, Institute of Research & Development France, San Diego Supercomputer Center involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.</p>
 
<p>I am an avid proponent of Open Source and credit my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, and many more. I have <strong>150+ media features, keynotes, conference talks, panels, workshops, and podcasts</strong> to my name, with renowned entities like <strong>Google, United Nations, NTD Business, International Business Times</strong>, SiliconAngle, CubeTV, etc. My love for tinkering has led me to win 5+ hackathons, sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Github, etc. and I now give back to the community by serving on the judges' panel of hackathons.</p>
 
<p>Apart from my technological ventures, I enjoy exploring hidden gems in my city, hanging out with friends and family, and have been recently having fun with baking.
